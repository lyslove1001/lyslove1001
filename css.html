        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document 
        written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] 
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 30px">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] 
        This separation can improve content accessibility; 
        provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
        css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; 
        and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
        page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
